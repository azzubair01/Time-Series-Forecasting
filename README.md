# Time Series Forecasting
- Making predictions about the future is called extrapolation in the classical statistical handling of time series data. More modern fields focus on the topic and refer to it as time series forecasting. Forecasting involves taking models fit on historical data and using them to predict future observations. An important distinction in forecasting is that the future is completely unavailable and must only be estimated from what has already happened. Most often, this relates to trend analysis, cyclical fluctuation analysis, and issues of seasonality. As with all forecasting methods, success is not guaranteed. 

## Types of Time Series Forecasting
- Univariate Forecasting
  - Refers to a time series that consists of single (scalar) observations recorded sequentially over equal time increments.
- Multivariate Forecasting
  - Refers to a time series that consists of multiple (scalar) observations recorded sequentially over equal time increments.
  
## Current Version
 - TSAF part 1 is univartiate forecasting
 - TSAF part 2 is multivariate forecasting
